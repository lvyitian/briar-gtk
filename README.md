# Briar GTK

A simple GTK app for [Briar](https://briar.app), built with Python and GNOME Builder.
It uses the
[Briar REST API](https://code.briarproject.org/briar/briar/blob/master/briar-headless/README.md)
and therefore requires Java.

## Design Goals

* Intuitive and simple UI, adaptive to different screen sizes (desktop and mobile devices)
