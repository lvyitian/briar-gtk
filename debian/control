Description: Secure messaging, anywhere
 Briar is a messaging app designed for activists, journalists, and anyone
 else who needs a safe, easy and robust way to communicate. Unlike
 traditional messaging apps, Briar doesn't rely on a central server -
 messages are synchronized directly between the users' devices. If the
 internet's down, Briar can sync via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi, keeping the
 information flowing in a crisis. If the internet's up, Briar can sync via
 the Tor network, protecting users and their relationships from
 surveillance.
 .
 This package contains the GTK desktop client.
